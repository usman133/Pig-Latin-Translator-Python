A Pig Latin translator program in Python that I made while learning Python in my own time. 

What does it do:

* Allows user to enter a word of their choice to translate
* Translates the word by removing the first letter of the word and adding 'ay' at the end. i.e Hello => Elloay
* Displays translation
